# 🎨 Ayu-Next Theme

Thanks to the [creator](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) for such a perfect theme for me, I have been using the SublimeText editor for a very long time, and over time I switched to Visual Studio Code

## Description

I write code every day and use my own theme, if I find any bugs in the display and rendering, I try to fix and update my theme as soon as possible, so updates are released very often 🎈😁
